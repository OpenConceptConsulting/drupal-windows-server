Drupal 7 & Windows Server Configuration (drupal-windows-server)
=====================

Right now this is largely based on Windows Server 2008 RC2, but we hope to soon have some documentation for Windows Server 2012.  

This was built for the Government of Canada's Web Experience Toolkit, but it could easily be used for any Drupal distribution.  

This is an evolving document and we encourage pull requests & issue submissions.
